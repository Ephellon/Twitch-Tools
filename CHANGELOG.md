# TTV Tools &mdash; To-Do List

# TO-DO &mdash; Known Issues

- [ ] Accessibility options?
- [ ] Add the **option** to keep Up Next purely unique
    * Maybe the user wants to create a repeating queue
    * Up Next does not currently allow duplicates
- [ ] Add the "Sync Activity across devices" option
    * If a channel is already being watched on a different machine, go to a different, unique channel
- [ ] Up Next sometimes goes in an irregular order
    * Caused by not setting the new first in line href (`new Sortable ← onUpdate ← if([...].contains(0))`:5715@v4.28)
        * Tentative fix `4.29`
        * Still present `5.23`
    * It might also not list jobs immediately
- [ ] Dead channels get re-added to Up Next sometimes
    * May have something to do with case sensitivity in HREFs?
    * My wife: "It seems to be going thru every channel and adding what it believes is the best fit"
- [-] Add cache logic to detect raids
    - Interferes with the AdBlock extension (pushes `ab_channel` to the URL, removing all other search parameters)
- [ ] Pause First in Line when observing a raid
    - Use the `UserIntent` variable to detect if a raid failed: variable not set and channel not followed
- [ ] Toggling Easy Lurk might cause theatre-mode to activate?
    * Tentative fix `v5.8`
    * Twitch keeps messing with the theatre-mode button's attributes
- [ ] Live Reminders might re-add all live channels?
    * Usually during raids (semi-intentional)
- [ ] Get `redo:boolean` from URL and control First in Line accordingly (commented-out: `repeat mini-button`)
- [ ] Add "Full Tab Captures" → https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabCapture/
- [ ] Garner user feedback → https://form.jotform.com/222442891146153
- [ ] Sometimes, chat bullets do not register in the main "catcher;" may be related to the reflector (after the initializer) → `TTV_IRC.socket?.reflect?.(...)`
    * Typically affects only user generated messages
- [-] Modify DVR logic to record over ads
    * Currently, skips entire ad section; does not substitute mini-video's contents in ads' place
- [ ] Add option to handle chat commands and messages
    * Might just need to make another extension for that
    * Responds to chat input (aka, a chat bot)
    * Made this at one point... didn't really see the need of it past nuance
- [-] Display a "Hey, these are new!" alert on the settings page
- [ ] There is an issue where all tabs will **not** be the Up Next owner
- [-] Add auto-save clip logic (handler) to navigation events: first in line, time out, etc.
- [-] Pause Up Next during trophy recording
- [x] Clips may not be saved when leaving/destroying page
    - Fails to initiate Alt+Z
- [x] Clips double-save upon completion
    - One clip is always just a preview image
- [ ] The background script may stall indefinitely when a tab disappears
- [ ] If a pre-roll ad plays, the recording feature stops working
- [x] Use Live Reminders as alternative stream sources for Up Next
- [-] Display alerts for Prime Gaming loot for specific games
- [ ] Finish JSDoc commenting
    - [x] background.js
    - [x] core.js
    - [ ] polyfills.js
    - [ ] tools.js
    - [ ] chat.js
    - [ ] player.js
    - [ ] glyphs.js
    - [ ] settings.js
- [ ] Change "Buy when available" channel point button to a selection dropdown
- [-] Fix memory leaks!
    - Most, big-name (+1GB) leaks were handled; others are commented out: `@performance`
        - Most atrocious offender was unused data in the `LIVE_REMINDERS__CHECKER` function, and other `new Search(...)` calls
    - The lesser leaks seem to freeze the tab(s) when removing them from memory in quick succession
    - [x] Caused in part by Hardware Acceleration
- [ ] Add option for DVR to record certain games
