# TTV Tools &mdash; To-Do List

# TO-DO &mdash; Known Issues

1. Accessibility options?
2. Add the **option** to keep Up Next purely unique
    * Maybe the user wants to create a repeating queue
    * Up Next does not currently allow duplicates
3. Add the "Sync Activity across devices" option
    * If a channel is already being watched on a different machine, go to a different, unique channel
4. Up Next sometimes goes in an irregular order
    * Caused by not setting the new first in line href (`new Sortable ← onUpdate ← if([...].contains(0))`:5715@v4.28)
        * Tentative fix `4.29`
        * Still present `5.23`
    * It might also not list jobs immediately
5. Dead channels get re-added to Up Next sometimes
    * May have something to do with case sensitivity in HREFs?
    * My wife: "It seems to be going thru every channel and adding what it believes is the best fit"
6. Pause First in Line when observing a raid
7. Toggling Easy Lurk might cause theatre-mode to activate?
    * Tentative fix `v5.8`
8. Live Reminders might re-add all live channels?
    * Usually during raids (semi-intentional)
9. Get `redo:boolean` from URL and control First in Line accordingly (commented-out: 'repeat mini-button')
10. Add logic to (video) record channel point redemptions
    * Like PSN trophies
11. Add "Full Tab Captures" → https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/tabCapture/
12. Garner user feedback → https://form.jotform.com/222442891146153
13. Offer an option to use Live Reminder channels after live followed channels have been exhausted
