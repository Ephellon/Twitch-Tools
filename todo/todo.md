# TTV Tools &mdash; To-Do List

# TO-DO &mdash; Known Issues

1. Accessibility options?
    * Not sure what to add...
2. Instance (tab) data separation?
    * Simply separate each tab's data for certain things, e.g. "Up Next"
3. "Predictive Raiding"
    * Uses the streamers' `dailyBroadcastTime` to predict when their stream will end
        * OR - listen for notifications/channel-popups; then save a timer (`{streamsCounted}:{totalSecondsCountedLive}`) for how long the channel lives
    * Heads to the stream 5min before it **should** end
    * Only applies to streams that have a `raidsLastWeek` &ge; 3
4. "Away Mode Lurking Schedule"
    * Automatically enables &/ disables Away Mode at user defined times
5. "Reverse Emotes"
    * Sets all emotes back to their text and displays the image in a tooltip
6. Add the option to keep Up Next purely unique
    * Maybe the user wants to create a repeating queue
7. Add the "Sync Activity across devices" option
    * If a channel is already being watched on a different machine, go to a different, unique channel

- Make initial loading actions less intrusive
    - [x] "Prime Loot" open/close action
    - [x] "Convert Emotes" open/close action
    - [x] "BetterTTV Emotes" open/close action
- [ ] Clean up SVGs & IMGs
- [x] Provide more concise and informative console messages
- [ ] Add more translations
- ~~Listen for "on-subscribe" events to update the Channel Points Multiplier?~~
    * Too invasive. Does not match importance in proportion

----

# FIXED &mdash; Fixed Issues

> [2.9](https://github.com/Ephellon/Twitch-Tools/releases/tag/2.9)*
1. Some elements don't register (like SVG animations)
    * Fixed? 2.9
2. The Up Next timer resets when clicking a channel from the side-panel
    * In work...
    * Fine how it is?
3. `UserIntent` doesn't prevent faulty "no longer live" from firing
    * Causes reloads?
    * Fixed. Was issue with "Stay Live" and page reloading
4. If the page isn't fully reloaded, pausing the timer doesn't work
    * Since 2.8.3
    * Fixed? 2.8.3
5. When all channels are deleted (on the side-panel by Twitch), First in Line re-adds all channels
    * Added code to *detect* if the channels were deleted, and ignore the change
    * Fixed? 2.8.3

> [2.8.8](https://github.com/Ephellon/Twitch-Tools/releases/tag/2.8.8)
1. Away-Mode displayed over the video keeps the "fullscreen" tooltip attached
    * Fixed. 2.8.8

> [2.8.3](https://github.com/Ephellon/Twitch-Tools/releases/tag/2.8.3)
1. Removing a channel from Up Next before it goes live re-adds it
    * Only when both First in Line features are enabled
    * Fixed: added code to ignore canceled jobs
        * Old "First in Line" Flow Chart:
            * `Twitch Notification` &rarr; FirstInLine Event &rarr; `User cancels event` &rarr; FirstInLinePlus Event
        * New "First in Line" Flow Chart:
            * `Twitch Notification` &rarr; FirstInLine Event &rarr; `User cancels event` &rarr; Interrupt @FirstInLine Event

> [2.8.2](https://github.com/Ephellon/Twitch-Tools/releases/tag/2.8.2)
1. If Up Next is set to off, the dead page will continue to reload
    - Change `GetNextStreamer` logic
2. If the Boost feature has anyone in the queue, the boost will activate by itself
    - Added `parseBool` function to check for actually falsy values
3. If too many channels are shown on the side-nav, others may be removed as they are seen as "dead"
    * Fixed? The extension loads more channels automatically
        * The jobs are marked as "dead" because there are too many elements and `isLive` can't access the elements properly
4. Switching to another channel causes the "Auto-Collect Bonus Points" to bleed into the next element
    * Fixable: there is a div with the "+X" points text that never gets deleted by Twitch
5. Jobs duplicate. From old job-names, and notifications (drop-down)
    * Fixed?
    * Fixed. Needed to ensure __all__ channels were added and not overridden
    * Also: needed to specify the location of the elements to watch (side-panel anchors v. all anchors)
6. Channels appearing but not counted in First in Line+
    * Fixed. Used `streamers` instead of `STREAMERS`
7. Added the ability for the extension to resolve crashed pages
    * OK. Added an interval job to `background.js`
8. Remove unused settings' names from `settings.js`
    * Done.

> [2.5.1](https://github.com/Ephellon/Twitch-Tools/releases/tag/2.5.1)
1. New channels that give a notification before appearing count as dead until the page reloads
    - `FIRST_IN_LINE_JOB = setInterval(...)`
    - Forgot to return a value for `.map`. We don't talk about it
2. Notifications sometimes don't trigger First in Line (job addition)
    - See above note
3. The chat popups don't propagate
    - Fixed.
