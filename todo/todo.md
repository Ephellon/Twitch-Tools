# TTV Tools &mdash; To-Do List

# TO-DO &mdash; Known Issues

1. Accessibility options?
    * "Reverse Emotes"
        + Sets all emotes back to their text and displays the image in a tooltip
2. Add the **option** to keep Up Next purely unique
    * Maybe the user wants to create a repeating queue
    * Up Next does not currently allow duplicates
3. Add the "Sync Activity across devices" option
    * If a channel is already being watched on a different machine, go to a different, unique channel
4. Remove more language dependencies
    * ~~`parseCoin` is language dependent - it only reads "SI" units~~
        * Tentative fix `4.11.5`
    * All bulletin filters are language dependent - they only recognize English
5. Add an "Auto-Spend" feature for Channel Points
    * If an item is disabled (available in a few streams, or out of stock), attempt to purchase it when available
6. Up Next sometimes goes in an irregular order
    * Not sure why
7. `chat.js` has an issue for card popups: `new Search` does not always complete
    * Changed to a raw search to remedy the issue
8. `v5` will need to be made in [`manifest V3`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-migration/)
    * Required by **Jan 2023**
